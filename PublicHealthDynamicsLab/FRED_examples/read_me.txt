These examples require FRED to be installed and run as an administrator.

The recommended way to run these examples is to:
1) Open FRED as an administrator via the Start menu shortcut

2) Change the working directory to the desired example (via unix styled path names)
So if tutorial_a is located at C:\PublicHealthDynamicsLab\FRED\FRED_examples\tutorial_a then just enter:

cd C:/PublicHealthDynamicsLab/FRED/FRED_examples/tutorial_a

to change to the tutorial_a directory (note the replacement of '\'s to '/'s).

3) Further instructions can be found in text files named after the examples
